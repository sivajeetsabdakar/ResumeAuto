MongoDB’s mission is to empower innovators to create, transform, and disrupt industries by unleashing the power of software and data. We enable organizations of all sizes to easily build, scale, and run modern applications by helping them modernize legacy workloads, embrace innovation, and unleash AI. Our industry-leading developer data platform, MongoDB Atlas, is the only globally distributed, multi-cloud database and is available in more than 115 regions across AWS, Google Cloud, and Microsoft Azure. Atlas allows customers to build anywhere—on the edge, on premises, or across cloud providers. With offices worldwide and over 175,000 developers joining MongoDB every month, it’s no wonder that leading organizations, like Samsung and Toyota, trust MongoDB to build next-generation, AI-powered applications.

### INSTRUCTIONS

**STEP 1: ANALYZE THE GAP**
* Extract the top 5-10 "Hard Skills" and keywords from the JD (e.g., specific languages, frameworks, cloud tools, methodologies).
* Compare these against the Base Resume.

**STEP 2: TAILOR THE CONTENT (Strict Rules)**
1.  **Summary:** Rewrite the professional summary to strictly align with the JD's job title and core requirements. Use keywords from the JD immediately. Start with Software Developer always.
2.  **Project Selection (Crucial):** * Select the top 3-4 projects from the Base Resume that best demonstrate the skills required in the JD. 
    * **REMOVE** projects that are irrelevant to save space. (e.g., if it's a Backend role, prioritize "HawkeRoute" and "QuickIntell"; if AI/ML, prioritize "AutoPrep" and "Flinder").
    * Do NOT Remove any experience, just enhance/edit them according to requirement.*
3.  **Bullet Point Refinement:** * Rewrite existing bullet points to mirror the terminology used in the JD. 
    * *Example:* If JD asks for "reducing latency," ensure the "50ms" metric is highlighted. 
    * *Constraint:* Do NOT invent too much of new metrics or lie too much about experiences. Only you can add a little bit of lies to match the JD's "requirements."
4.  **Technical Skills Section:** Reorder and add/remove skills in the skills list so that the technologies mentioned in the JD appear **first** in their respective categories.
5. Do not edit in ACHIEVEMENTS (to avoid looking like AI generated)

**STEP 3: ATS OPTIMIZATION**
* Ensure standard section headers are used (EXPERIENCE, PROJECTS, EDUCATION, SKILLS).
* Remove complex formatting or columns (output as clean, plain text or Markdown).

### FORMATTING RULES
* **DO NOT** use flowery language or "AI buzzwords" (e.g., "Passionate about," "spearheaded"). Use strong action verbs (Architected, Engineered, Deployed).
* **DO NOT** hallucinate. If the JD requires a skill (e.g., Java) that is NOT in the Base Resume, do add it.
