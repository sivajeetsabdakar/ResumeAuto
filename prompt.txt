### INSTRUCTIONS

**STEP 1: ANALYZE THE GAP**
* Extract the top 5-10 "Hard Skills" and keywords from the JD (e.g., specific languages, frameworks, cloud tools, methodologies).
* Compare these against the given latex code Resume.

**STEP 2: TAILOR THE CONTENT (Strict Rules)**
1.  **Summary:** Rewrite the professional summary to strictly align with the JD's job title and core requirements. Use keywords from the JD immediately. Start with Computer Science Pre Final year student always.
2.  **Project Selection (Crucial):** * Select the top 3-4 projects from the Base Resume that best demonstrate the skills required in the JD. Write them in specifc detail.
    * **REMOVE** projects that are irrelevant to save space. 
    * Do NOT Remove any experience, just enhance/edit them according to requirement.*
3.  **Bullet Point Refinement:** * Rewrite existing bullet points to mirror the terminology used in the JD. 
    * *Example:* If JD asks for "reducing latency," ensure the "50ms" metric is highlighted. 
    * *Constraint:* Do NOT invent too much of new metrics or lie too much about experiences. Only you can add a little bit of lies to match the JD's "requirements."
4.  **Technical Skills Section:** Reorder and add/remove skills in the skills list so that the technologies mentioned in the JD appear **first** in their respective categories.
5. Do not edit in ACHIEVEMENTS (to avoid looking like AI generated)

**STEP 3: ATS OPTIMIZATION**
* Ensure standard section headers are used (EXPERIENCE, PROJECTS, EDUCATION, SKILLS).
* Remove complex formatting or columns (output as clean, plain text or Markdown).
* Reverify for avoiding repition (keywords and stuff).

### FORMATTING RULES
* **DO NOT** use flowery language or "AI buzzwords" (e.g., "Passionate about," "spearheaded"). Use strong action verbs (Architected, Engineered, Deployed).
* **DO NOT** hallucinate. 
* **AVOID REPITITION** of words, phrases and tone.
